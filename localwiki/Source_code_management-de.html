This article explains how to use it and how some general rules apply in the case of FreeCAD. You are highly advised to learn how git works first (there are a lot of tutorials and docs available for git on the internet) before working with the FreeCAD source code.
</p><p>There are also many good graphical clients to git, such as <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://github.com/git-cola/git-cola">git-cola</a>, that make the whole process of managing git repositories easier.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Source_Code_Access">Source Code Access</span></h2>
<p>Everybody can access and get a copy of the FreeCAD source code, but only the FreeCAD project managers have write access to it. You can get a copy of the code, study it and modify it as you wish, but if you make a change that you wish to see included in the official source code, you need to ask for a pull request on the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://forum.freecadweb.org/viewforum.php?f=17">pull requests</a> section of the FreeCAD forum.
</p>
<div class="note"><b>NOTE</b>
<p>In all examples below, "USERNAME" represents your GitHub user account.
</p>
</div>
<p><br />
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Official_GitHub_Repo">Official GitHub Repo</span></h3>
<p>An easy way to start with the FreeCAD source code is using the official FreeCAD repository at
<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD">https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD</a>
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Setting_your_git_username">Setting your git username</span></h3>
<p>Users should commit to their project repository using their GitHub username. 
If that is not already set globally, you can set it locally for the current Git repository like this:
</p>
<pre>git config user.name "YOUR NAME"
git config user.email "USERNAME@users.noreply.github.com"
</pre>
<p>You can now use some combination of "git add" and "git commit" commands to create one or more 
commits in your local repository.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Fork_on_GitHub">Fork on GitHub</span></h4>
<p>You can start simply by using the "fork" button on top of the above page. This will create a copy of the FreeCAD repository on your own GitHub account. The general procedure is as follows:
</p>
<ol><li> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://github.com/join">Sign up</a> for a GitHub account </li>
<li> Go to the FreeCAD repo:  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD">https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD</a></li>
<li> Press the "Fork" button</li>
<li> On your machine, clone your newly created FreeCAD fork:
<dl><dd>  <pre>git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/FreeCAD.git</pre></dd></dl></li>
<li> Create and checkout a new branch simultaneously
<dl><dd>  <pre>git checkout -b newfeature</pre></dd></dl></li>
<li> Commit your changes to that new branch</li>
<li> Push that new branch to your GitHub repo</li></ol>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Git_clone_to_your_local_machine">Git clone to your local machine</span></h4>
<p>You can also start normally, without using the "fork" button:
</p>
<ol><li> Clone the FreeCAD code with git: 
<dl><dd> <pre>git clone https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD.git</pre></dd></dl></li>
<li> Create and checkout a new branch simultaneously
<dl><dd>  <pre>git checkout -b newfeature</pre></dd></dl></li>
<li> Commit your changes to that new branch</li>
<li> Create an account on a public git server (GitHub, GitLab, etc...)</li>
<li> Push your branch to that server</li></ol>
<p><i>Important Note</i>: If you have code you wish to see merged into the FreeCAD source code, please post a note in the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://forum.freecadweb.org/viewforum.php?f=17">Pull Requests</a> section of the FreeCAD forum.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Alternative_repositories">Alternative repositories</span></h3>
<p>The beauty of git is that everybody can clone a project, and start modifying the code. Several frequent collaborators of the FreeCAD project have their own git repository, where they build up their work before it is ready to be included in the official source code, or simply where they experiment new ideas. In certain cases, you might want to clone your FreeCAD code from one of these, instead of the official repos, to benefit from the changes their users did.
</p><p>Be warned, though, that this is at your own risk, and only the official repository above is fully guaranteed to work and contain clean code.
</p><p>It is also possible to attach several remote repositories to a same local FreeCAD git code, using the "git remote" command. This is useful to keep in sync with the master code branch, but keep an eye on the work of different developers.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Git_Development_Process">Git Development Process</span></h2>
<p>First of all <b>never develop on the <i>master</i> branch!</b> Create a local branch for development. 
You can learn how to do this <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://book.git-scm.com/3_basic_branching_and_merging.html">here</a>.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Branching">Branching</span></h3>
<p>An important feature of Git is that it is extremely easy to work with branches and merge 
them together. Best practices recommend to create a new branch whenever you want to work 
on a new feature. Creating a branch is done with:
</p>
<pre>git branch myNewBranch
git checkout myNewBranch
</pre>
<p>or, both operation in one:
</p>
<pre>git checkout -b myNewBranch
</pre>
<p>you can always check in which branch you are with:
</p>
<pre>git branch
</pre>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Committing">Committing</span></h3>
<p>Once you did some work, you commit them with:
</p>
<pre>git commit -a
</pre>
<p>Unlike SVN, you need to specifically tell which files to commit (or all with the 
-a option). Your text editor will open to allow you to write a commit message.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Publishing_your_work_on_your_GitHub_repository">Publishing your work on your GitHub repository</span></h3>
<p>After done some changes on your local branch and commit it (this means commit 
<i>locally</i>) you can push your repository to the server. This opens your branch 
to the public and allows the main developers to review and integrate your 
branch into <i>master</i>. 
</p>
<pre>git push my-branch
</pre>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Writing_good_commit_messages">Writing good commit messages</span></h3>
<p>You should try to work in small chunks.  If you cannot summarize your changes in one 
sentence, then it has probably been too long since you have made a commit.  It is also 
important that you have helpful and useful descriptions of your work. For commit messages, 
FreeCAD has adopted a format mentioned in book Pro Git (see <a href="#Further_Reading">#Further Reading</a>).
</p>
<pre>Short (50 chars or less) summary of changes

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Wrap it to about 72
characters or so.  In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body.  The blank
line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run the
two together.

Further paragraphs come after blank lines. 

 - Bullet points are okay, too

 - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded by a
   single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions vary here
</pre>
<p>If you are doing a lot of related work, it has been suggested 
<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=2062&amp;p=14887#p14886">here</a> 
that one should make as many commits large or small as makes sense for what you are working 
on using the short one sentence commit messages. When you want to merge,  do a 
git log master..BRANCH and use the output as a basis for your quality commit message. 
Then when you merge to master use the --squash option and commit with your quality commit message. 
This will allow you to be very liberal with your commits and help to provide a good level of detail 
in commit messages without so many distinct descriptions.
