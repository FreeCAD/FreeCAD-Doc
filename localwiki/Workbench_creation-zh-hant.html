<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_workbench_structure">The workbench structure</span></h2>
<p>Basically it is simple: You need a folder, with any name you like, placed in the Mod directory, with an <b>Init.py</b> file, and, optionally an <b>InitGui.py</b> file. The Init file is executed when FreeCAD starts, always, and the InitGui.py file is executed immediately after, but only when FreeCAD starts in GUI mode, not in console mode. That's all it needs for FreeCAD to find your workbench at startup and add it to its interface.
</p><p>Inside those files you can do whatever you want. Usually they are used like this:
</p>
<ul><li> In the Init.py file you just add a couple of things used even when FreeCAD works in console mode, for example the file importers and exporters</li></ul>
<ul><li> In the InitGui.py file you usually define a workbench, which contains a name, an icon, and a series of FreeCAD commands (see below). That workbench also defines functions that are executed when FreeCAD loads (you try to do as little as possible there, so you don't slow down the startup), another that gets executed when the workbench is activated (that's where you'll do most of the work), and a third one when the workbench is deactivated (so you can remove things if needed).</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="C.2B.2B_workbench_structure">C++ workbench structure</span></h3>
<p>If you are going to code your workbench in python, you don't need to take special care, and can simply place your other python files together with your Init.py and InitGui.py files. When working with C++, however, you should take greater care, and start with respecting one fundamental rule of FreeCAD: The separation of your workbench between an App part (that can run in console mode, without any GUI element), and a Gui part, which will only be loaded when FreeCAD runs with its full GUI environment. So when doing a C++ workbench, you will actually most likely be doing two modules, an App and a Gui. These two modules must of course be callable from python. Any FreeCAD module (App or Gui) consists, at the very least, of a module init file. This is a typical AppMyModuleGui.cpp file:
</p>
<pre>extern "C" {
    void MyModuleGuiExport initMyModuleGui()  
    {
         if (!Gui::Application::Instance) {
            PyErr_SetString(PyExc_ImportError, "Cannot load Gui module in console application.");
            return;
        }
        try {
            // import other modules this one depends on
            Base::Interpreter().runString("import PartGui");
            // run some python code in the console
            Base::Interpreter().runString("print('welcome to my module!')");
        }
        catch(const Base::Exception&amp; e) {
            PyErr_SetString(PyExc_ImportError, e.what());
            return;
        }
        (void) Py_InitModule("MyModuleGui", MyModuleGui_Import_methods);   /* mod name, table ptr */
        Base::Console().Log("Loading GUI of MyModule... done\n");
    
        // initializes the FreeCAD commands (in another cpp file)
        CreateMyModuleCommands();
    
        // initializes workbench and object definitions
        MyModuleGui::Workbench::init();
        MyModuleGui::ViewProviderSomeCustomObject::init();
    
         // add resources and reloads the translators
        loadMyModuleResource();
    }
} </pre>

<p>You can choose any license you like for your workbench, but be aware that if you wish 
to see your workbench integrated into and distributed with the FreeCAD source code at 
some point, it needs to be LGPL2+ like the example above.
The FreeCAD.addImportType() and addEXportType() functions allow you to give the name 
and extension of a file type, and a python module responsible for its import. In the 
example above, an "importOwn.py" module will handle .own files. See <a href="Code_snippets.html" title="Code snippets">Code snippets</a> 
for more examples.
</p>

    MenuText = "My Workbench"
    ToolTip = "A description of my workbench"
    Icon = """paste here the contents of a 16x16 xpm icon"""

    def Initialize(self):
        "This function is executed when FreeCAD starts"
        import MyModuleA, MyModuleB # import here all the needed files that create your FreeCAD commands
        self.list = ["MyCommand1, MyCommand2"] # A list of command names created in the line above
        self.appendToolbar("My Commands",self.list) # creates a new toolbar with your commands

    def ContextMenu(self, recipient):

<p>Other than that, you can do anything you want: You could put your whole workbench code 
inside the InitGui.py if you want, but it is usually more convenient to place the different 
functions of your workbench in separate files. So those files are smaller and easier to 
read. Then you import those files into your InitGui.py file. You can organize those files 
the way you want, a good example is one for each FreeCAD command you add.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="C.2B.2B_workbenches">C++ workbenches</span></h3>
<p>If you are going to code your workbench in C++, you will probably want to code the
workbench definition itself in C++ too (although it is not necessary: You could also
code only the tools in C++, and leave the workbench definition in python). In that case,
the InitGui.py file becomes very simple: It might contain just one line:
</p>
<pre>import MyModuleGui </pre>
<p>where MyModule is your complete C++ workbench, including the commands and workbench
definition.
</p><p>Coding C++ workbenches works in a pretty similar way. This is a typical Workbench.cpp
file to include in the Gui part of your module:
</p>
<pre>namespace MyModuleGui {
    class MyModuleGuiExport Workbench&#160;: public Gui::StdWorkbench
    {
        TYPESYSTEM_HEADER();

    public:
        Workbench();
        virtual ~Workbench();

        virtual void activated();
        virtual void deactivated();

    protected:
        Gui::ToolBarItem* setupToolBars() const;
        Gui::MenuItem*    setupMenuBar() const;
    };
} </pre>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="FreeCAD_commands">FreeCAD commands</span></h2>
<p>FreeCAD commands are the basic building block of the FreeCAD interface. They can appear 
as a button on toolbars, and as a menu entry in menus. But it is the same command. A 
command is a simple python class, that must contain a couple of predefined attributes 
and functions, that define the name of the command, its icon, and what to do when the 
command is activated.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Python_command_definition">Python command definition</span></h3>
<pre>class My_Command_Class():
    """My new command"""

                'Accel'&#160;: "Shift+S", # a default shortcut (optional)
                'MenuText': "My New Command"
                'ToolTip'&#160;: "What my new command does"}

    def Activated(self):
        "Do something here"
        return

    def IsActive(self):

        return True

FreeCADGui.addCommand('My_Command',My_Command_Class()) </pre>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="C.2B.2B_command_definition">C++ command definition</span></h3>
<p>Similarly, you can code your commands in C++, typically have a Commands.cpp file in your Gui module. This is a typical Commands.cpp file:
</p>
<pre>DEF_STD_CMD_A(CmdMyCommand);

CmdMyCommand::CmdMyCommand()
 &#160;:Command("My_Command")

  sStatusTip    = QT_TR_NOOP("Describes what my command does");
  sPixmap       = "some_svg_icon_from_my_resource";
}
